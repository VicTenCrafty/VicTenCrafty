**Hi, I'm Vic!**

My main programming language is **Python** with about an year of experience, but I started with **Lua** on Roblox in which I have coded for about a year! I'm currently learning to develop 3D games with C++

I'm looking to create notable projects, currently focusing on getting my web skills up.
